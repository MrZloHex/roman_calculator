# Roman calculator
This is a small project that calculates the result of an arithmetic expression 
with roman numbers (I, V, X, L, C, D, M, Z=0), basic operations (+, -, *, /) as well as parentheses.

# Compile and launch
`make run` to run the program. When launched, just enter expressions using roman numbers.
`make test` to run the tests.

Note that the result of the expression should be smaller than 10^9;
